## General info
This software retrieves hourly KNMI weather data (temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, etc.), processes the raw files, and applies geospatial interpolation to provide weather time series for arbitrary locations in the Netherlands.  

The code builds on earlier developments in the Twomes, Brains4Buildings, and REDUCEDHEATCARB projects.  
It is designed for integration with energy transition datasets such as [NeedForHeat](https://github.com/energietransitie/needforheat-dataset), but can also be used as a standalone tool.

## Deploying

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or later
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Main dependencies:
* pandas
* numpy
* scipy
* requests
* tqdm

## Usage
Example: retrieve weather data for a single location and time span:

```python
from weather_extraction import get_weather_timeseries
import pandas as pd

start = pd.Timestamp("2024-01-01T00:00:00Z")
end   = pd.Timestamp("2024-01-07T23:00:00Z")

df = get_weather_timeseries(
    lat_degN=52.140,
    lon_degE=6.200,
    start=start,
    end=end
)
```
This returns a pandas DataFrame with interpolated weather parameters.

## Developing

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Recommended: a virtual environment

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Contributing
